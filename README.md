# MonteCarloPandemic
Variety of Monte Carlo Simulations showing how diseases spread given certain parameters.

# Base
The base model shows how individuals undergoing random walk might contract a disease given a small seed population of infected individuals

# Parameters (WIP)
The parameters can be edited to see how various measures affect infection rate.

### Editable parameters:
- Population density (done)
- Individual locality (i.e. how far do people walk) (done)
- R naught (done)
- Death rate (in progress)
